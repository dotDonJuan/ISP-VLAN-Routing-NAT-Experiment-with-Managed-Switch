# ISP-VLAN-Routing-NAT-Experiment-with-Managed-Switch
This repository documents my study and configuration experiments for setting up an ISP connection over VLAN using a manageable switch. The goal is to route internet access through a VLAN-tagged WAN port while allowing internal VLANs (e.g., local network segments) to access the internet via Network Address Translation (NAT).
